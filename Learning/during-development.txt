---> Write all steps, you will perform in the functions. That steps are algorithms.

---> Before write your code, try to understand 
        (1) Input format    (use Postman for it)
        (2) Output format

---> Test your application while writing code so that you will face less error and debug would be wasy.

---> First focus on Feature of your application, then opimize that code.



---> To Test API where, we have file,
            you can't use "body->json". Because there is no option to send file.
            for that, we use "body->form-data" to send file from POSTMAN.
